## 3. Stripe Integration

Stripe is a widely used online payment processing platform that offers comprehensive APIs and SDKs, making it convenient for developers to incorporate payment features into their applications.

### 3.1 Basic Setup

#### 3.1.1 Account Registration and Setup

Begin by registering an account on the [Stripe official website](https://stripe.com). After registration, log in to the Stripe Dashboard to access your API keys and manage your account settings.

#### 3.1.2 API Keys Configuration

In the Stripe Dashboard under the "Developers" section, locate your API keys. You'll need both the **Publishable Key** (used on the client side) and the **Secret Key** (used on the server side). Ensure these keys are securely stored and not exposed publicly.

#### 3.1.3 SDK Installation

**Installing the Golang SDK**

```bash
go get -u github.com/stripe/stripe-go/v81
```

**Install the React Stripe libraries**

```bash
npm install @stripe/react-stripe-js @stripe/stripe-js
```

### 3.2 Payment Flow Implementation

Here's the Stripe payment flow swimlane diagram.

![stripe-payment-process.png](./stripe-payment-process.png)

#### 3.2.1 Creating Payment Intents

The Payment Intents API is central to Stripe's payment processing, allowing you to manage the lifecycle of a payment.

```go
package main


import (
    "encoding/json"
    "log"
    "net/http"
    "os"
    "strconv"


    "github.com/joho/godotenv"
    "github.com/stripe/stripe-go/v81"
    "github.com/stripe/stripe-go/v81/paymentintent"
)


func createPaymentIntentHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    w.Header().Set("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")
    w.Header().Set("Access-Control-Allow-Methods", "*")
    w.Header().Set("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "*")
    if r.Method == "OPTIONS" {
       w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
       return
    }


    err := r.ParseForm()
    if err != nil {
       http.Error(w, "Form parsed failed", http.StatusBadRequest)
    }
    amountStr := r.FormValue("amount")
    amount, err := strconv.ParseInt(amountStr, 10, 64)
    if err != nil {
       http.Error(w, "Invalid amount", http.StatusBadRequest)
       return
    }
    params := &stripe.PaymentIntentParams{
       Amount:   stripe.Int64(amount * 100),
       Currency: stripe.String(string(stripe.CurrencyUSD)),
    }
    paymentIntent, err := paymentintent.New(params)
    if err != nil {
       http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusInternalServerError)
       return
    }
    w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
    err = json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(map[string]string{
       "clientSecret": paymentIntent.ClientSecret,
    })
    if err != nil {
       http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusInternalServerError)
       return
    }
}


func main() {
    if err := godotenv.Load(); err != nil {
       log.Fatalln("Error loading .env file")
    }


    stripe.Key = os.Getenv("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY")


    http.HandleFunc("/create-payment-intent", createPaymentIntentHandler)


    if err := http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil); err != nil {
       log.Fatalf("Failed to listen on port 8080: %v", err)
    } else {
       log.Println("Server started successfully on :8080")
    }
}
```

In this code, we initialize the Stripe API with your secret key, create a PaymentIntent with the specified amount and currency, and return the client secret to the frontend.

#### 3.2.2 Client-side Payment Elements

Stripe's React components, known as Elements, provide a secure and customizable way to collect payment information.

```javascript
'use client'


import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { Elements, PaymentElement } from '@stripe/react-stripe-js';
import { loadStripe } from '@stripe/stripe-js';


const stripePromise = loadStripe(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY!);


export default function Home() {
    const [clientSecret, setClientSecret] = useState<string>();


    useEffect(() => {
        fetch('/create-payment-intent', {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' },
            body: new URLSearchParams({ amount: '100' }).toString(),
        })
            .then(res => res.json())
            .then(data => setClientSecret(data.clientSecret));
    }, []);


    if (!clientSecret) {
        return <div>Loading...</div>;
    }


    return (
        <Elements stripe={stripePromise} options={{ clientSecret }}>
            <form>
                <PaymentElement/>
                <button>Submit</button>
            </form>
        </Elements>
    );
};
```

Here, we load Stripe.js, set up the Elements provider with the public key, and create a checkout form that includes the PaymentElement. The form handles the payment submission process.

#### 3.2.3 Handling Payment Results

To handle payment results, especially asynchronous events, Stripe recommends using webhooks.

```go
func webhookHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // Retrieve the signature header
    sigHeader := r.Header.Get("Stripe-Signature")
    payload, err := io.ReadAll(r.Body)
    if err != nil {
       http.Error(w, "Unable to read request body", http.StatusBadRequest)
       return
    }


    // Replace with your Webhook secret
    endpointSecret := "whsec_..." // Your Webhook secret
    event, err := webhook.ConstructEvent(payload, sigHeader, endpointSecret)
    if err != nil {
       http.Error(w, fmt.Sprintf("Signature verification failed: %v", err), http.StatusBadRequest)
       return
    }


    // Handle the event
    switch event.Type {
    case "payment_intent.succeeded":
       var paymentIntent stripe.PaymentIntent
       err := json.Unmarshal(event.Data.Raw, &paymentIntent)
       if err != nil {
          http.Error(w, fmt.Sprintf("Error parsing webhook JSON: %v", err), http.StatusBadRequest)
          return
       }
       fmt.Printf("Payment succeeded: %s\n", paymentIntent.ID)
       // Add your business logic here, e.g., update order status
    default:
       fmt.Printf("Unhandled event type: %s\n", event.Type)
    }


    // Respond with a 200 status to acknowledge receipt of the event
    w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
}


http.HandleFunc("/webhook", webhookHandler)
```

In this code, the `webhookHandler` function processes incoming Webhook requests. It retrieves the Stripe signature from the request header and reads the request body. Then, it uses your Webhook secret to verify the signature, ensuring the request is from Stripe. Based on the event type, it processes the corresponding business logic.

**Verify Webhook Signature**:

To ensure the security of the request, you need to verify the signature of the Webhook request sent by Stripe. The code above uses Stripe's Go library's `webhook.ConstructEvent` function to perform signature verification.

**Handle Payment Success Event**:

In the `handleWebhook` function, when a `payment_intent.succeeded` event is received, you can access the `PaymentIntent` object and add your business logic, such as updating the order status or sending notifications.

**Start the Server**:

Run your Go application, ensuring the server listens on the specified port (8080 in the example above).

**Register Webhook Endpoint in Stripe**:

Log in to your Stripe Dashboard, navigate to the Webhooks section, add your Webhook endpoint URL, and select the event types you want to receive, such as `payment_intent.succeeded`.

#### **3.2.4 Local Development Testing Considerations**

When developing locally, Stripe needs to communicate with your local server. Since your local server isn't publicly accessible, you can use a tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/downloads) to create a secure tunnel to your localhost.

**Install ngrok**:

1. Download and install ngrok from the official website.

**Start ngrok**:

Run ngrok to expose your local server:

```bash
ngrok http 8080
```

This command will provide a public URL (e.g., `https://<random_subdomain>.ngrok.io`) that forwards requests to your local server.

**Update Stripe Webhook Endpoint**:

In your Stripe Dashboard, update the Webhook endpoint URL to the ngrok URL provided (e.g., `https://<random_subdomain>.ngrok.io/webhook`).

**Test Webhook Events**:

You can now test Webhook events by sending them to your ngrok URL. Stripe will forward the events to your local server, allowing you to test your Webhook handling logic.

By following these steps, you can effectively handle Stripe payment success Webhook events in Go and test them during local development.

### 3.3 Advanced Features

Stripe is a powerful payment processing platform that offers a wide range of advanced features to handle complex payment scenarios. In this article, we will explore some of these advanced features, including **Saving Payment Methods**, **Subscription Payments**, **Refund Processing**, and **Multi-currency Support**. We'll discuss their use cases and provide complete Go code examples for each feature.

#### 3.3.1 Saving Payment Methods

Saving payment methods allows you to store a customer's payment details securely for future use. This is particularly useful for recurring payments, one-click checkouts, or when you want to offer a seamless payment experience without requiring the customer to re-enter their payment details.

```go
func savePaymentMethod() {
    // Create a new customer
    customerParams := &stripe.CustomerParams{
       Email: stripe.String("customer@example.com"),
    }
    c, err := customer.New(customerParams)
    if err != nil {
       log.Fatalf("Error creating customer: %v", err)
    }


    // Attach a payment method to the customer
    paymentMethodParams := &stripe.PaymentMethodParams{
       Type: stripe.String("card"),
       Card: &stripe.PaymentMethodCardParams{
          Number:   stripe.String("4242424242424242"),
          ExpMonth: stripe.Int64(12),
          ExpYear:  stripe.Int64(2025),
          CVC:      stripe.String("123"),
       },
    }
    pm, err := paymentmethod.New(paymentMethodParams)
    if err != nil {
       log.Fatalf("Error creating payment method: %v", err)
    }


    attachParams := &stripe.PaymentMethodAttachParams{
       Customer: stripe.String(c.ID),
    }
    _, err = paymentmethod.Attach(pm.ID, attachParams)
    if err != nil {
       log.Fatalf("Error attaching payment method: %v", err)
    }


    fmt.Printf("Payment method %s saved for customer %s\n", pm.ID, c.ID)
}
```

#### 3.3.2 Subscription Payments

Subscription payments are ideal for businesses offering recurring services, such as SaaS platforms, membership sites, or subscription boxes. Stripe handles the complexity of recurring billing, including prorations, trial periods, and automatic retries.

```go
func createSubscriptionPayment() {
    // Create a new customer
    customerParams := &stripe.CustomerParams{
       Email: stripe.String("customer@example.com"),
    }
    c, err := customer.New(customerParams)
    if err != nil {
       log.Fatalf("Error creating customer: %v", err)
    }


    // Attach a payment method to the customer
    paymentMethodParams := &stripe.PaymentMethodParams{
       Type: stripe.String("card"),
       Card: &stripe.PaymentMethodCardParams{
          Number:   stripe.String("4242424242424242"),
          ExpMonth: stripe.Int64(12),
          ExpYear:  stripe.Int64(2025),
          CVC:      stripe.String("123"),
       },
    }
    pm, err := paymentmethod.New(paymentMethodParams)
    if err != nil {
       log.Fatalf("Error creating payment method: %v", err)
    }


    attachParams := &stripe.PaymentMethodAttachParams{
       Customer: stripe.String(c.ID),
    }
    _, err = paymentmethod.Attach(pm.ID, attachParams)
    if err != nil {
       log.Fatalf("Error attaching payment method: %v", err)
    }


    // Create a subscription
    subscriptionParams := &stripe.SubscriptionParams{
       Customer: stripe.String(c.ID),
       Items: []*stripe.SubscriptionItemsParams{
          {
             Price: stripe.String("price_1J9Z2Z2eZvKYlo2C3ZJZ3Z3Z"),
          },
       },
    }
    subscription, err := sub.New(subscriptionParams)
    if err != nil {
       log.Fatalf("Error creating subscription: %v", err)
    }


    fmt.Printf("Subscription %s created for customer %s\n", subscription.ID, c.ID)
}
```

#### 3.3.3 Refund Processing

Refunds are essential for maintaining customer satisfaction and handling disputes. Stripe allows you to issue full or partial refunds, either immediately or at a later date.

```go
func refundChange() {
    // Create a charge
    chargeParams := &stripe.ChargeParams{
       Amount:   stripe.Int64(1000),
       Currency: stripe.String(string(stripe.CurrencyUSD)),
       Source: &stripe.PaymentSourceSourceParams{
          Token: stripe.String("tok_visa"),
       },
    }
    ch, err := charge.New(chargeParams)
    if err != nil {
       log.Fatalf("Error creating charge: %v", err)
    }


    // Create a refund
    refundParams := &stripe.RefundParams{
       Charge: stripe.String(ch.ID),
       Amount: stripe.Int64(500),
    }
    r, err := refund.New(refundParams)
    if err != nil {
       log.Fatalf("Error creating refund: %v", err)
    }


    fmt.Printf("Refund %s processed for charge %s\n", r.ID, ch.ID)
}
```

#### 3.3.4 Multi-currency Support

Multi-currency support is crucial for businesses operating in multiple countries. Stripe allows you to charge customers in their local currency, which can improve conversion rates and customer satisfaction.

![image-20250305150045179](./paypal-payment-process.png)

#### 4.2.1 PayPal Button Integration

Add PayPal SDK:

```bash
npm install @paypal/react-paypal-js
```

Integrate PayPal Buttons:

```javascript
import {
    PayPalButtons,
    PayPalButtonsComponentProps,
    PayPalScriptProvider,
    ReactPayPalScriptOptions,
} from "@paypal/react-paypal-js";


export default function App() {
    const initialOptions: ReactPayPalScriptOptions = {
        clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
    };


    const createOrder: PayPalButtonsComponentProps["createOrder"] = async () => {
        const response = await fetch("/create-paypal-order", {
            method: "POST",
            headers: {
                "Content-Type": "application/json",
            },
            body: JSON.stringify({
                cart: [
                    {
                        sku: "YOUR_PRODUCT_STOCK_KEEPING_UNIT",
                        quantity: "YOUR_PRODUCT_QUANTITY",
                    },
                ],
            }),
        });


        const data = await response.json();


        return data.id;
    };


    const onApprove: PayPalButtonsComponentProps["onApprove"] = async (data) => {
        // Capture the funds from the transaction.
        const response = await fetch("/capture-paypal-order", {
            method: "POST",
            body: JSON.stringify({
                orderID: data.orderID,
            }),
        });


        const details = await response.json();


        // Show success message to buyer
        alert(`Transaction completed by ${details.payer.name.given_name}`);
    };


    return (
        <div className="App">
            <PayPalScriptProvider options={initialOptions}>
                <PayPalButtons createOrder={createOrder} onApprove={onApprove} />
            </PayPalScriptProvider>
        </div>
    );
}
```

#### 4.2.2 Payment Flow Handling in Go

Since PayPal does not officially provide a Go SDK, you can use the standard `net/http` library or a community-supported library like `github.com/plutov/paypal/v4`

Install the Library:

```bash
go get github.com/plutov/paypal/v4
```

Initialize the Client:

```go
package main


import (
    "github.com/plutov/paypal/v4"
    "log"
    "context"
)


func main() {
    c, err := paypal.NewClient("YOUR_CLIENT_ID", "YOUR_SECRET", paypal.APIBaseSandBox)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }   
}
```

create and  capture order：

```go
package main


import (
	"context"
	"encoding/json"
	"log"
	"net/http"


	"github.com/plutov/paypal/v4"
)


var client *paypal.Client


func main() {
	var err error
	// Initialize the PayPal client with your credentials
	client, err = paypal.NewClient("YOUR_CLIENT_ID", "YOUR_SECRET", paypal.APIBaseSandBox)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Error initializing PayPal client: %v", err)
	}


	http.HandleFunc("/create-paypal-order", createPayPalOrder)
	http.HandleFunc("/capture-paypal-order", capturePayPalOrder)
	log.Println("Server listening on :8080")
	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
}


// createPayPalOrder creates a PayPal order
func createPayPalOrder(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	var purchaseUnit = paypal.PurchaseUnitRequest{
		Amount: &paypal.PurchaseUnitAmount{
			Currency: "USD",
			Value:    "100.00",
		},
		Description: "Order description",
	}


	var applicationContext = &paypal.ApplicationContext{
		ReturnURL:          "https://example.com/success",
		CancelURL:          "https://example.com/cancel",
		ShippingPreference: paypal.ShippingPreferenceNoShipping,
		LandingPage:        "BILLING",
		UserAction:         paypal.UserActionPayNow,
	}


	purchaseUnits := []paypal.PurchaseUnitRequest{purchaseUnit}
	order, err := client.CreateOrder(context.Background(), paypal.OrderIntentCapture, purchaseUnits, nil, applicationContext)
	if err != nil {
		http.Error(w, "Error creating order", http.StatusInternalServerError)
		return
	}


	w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
	json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(map[string]string{
		"id": order.ID,
	})
}


// capturePayPalOrder captures a PayPal order to confirm the payment
func capturePayPalOrder(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	var requestData map[string]string
	err := json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&requestData)
	if err != nil {
		http.Error(w, "Invalid request", http.StatusBadRequest)
