## Introduction

Modern web development has come a long way from the days of manually writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a simple text editor. The front-end ecosystem has grown exponentially, with many tools, frameworks, and libraries now available to developers. Because of the expansive choices available and the need for compatibility among them, deciding which to include in your organization's front-end build pipeline has become more complex than ever.  

We'll show you six ways modernizing your front-end build pipeline streamlines development, improves performance, and ensures maintainable code. These tools will, most of all, allow you to build innovative features and create exceptional customer experiences that will inspire customers to return to your app and use it more often.


## Implementing a JavaScript Framework or Library

Modern front-end development often relies on powerful JavaScript frameworks and libraries like [React](https://react.dev/), [Angular](https://angular.io), and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/). These frameworks simplify development, improve code quality, offer pre-built components, and provide support, making the development process more efficient, maintainable, and scalable.

+   **Efficiency:** Frameworks provide pre-built components and tools that make development faster and more efficient.
+   **Code Reusability:** Frameworks promote code reuse, allowing developers to use pre-built components and libraries, saving time and effort.
+   **Best Practices:** Frameworks come with established guidelines and coding conventions that improve code quality and maintainability.
+   **Abstraction of Complexity:** Frameworks handle complex tasks, such as browser compatibility and data management, so developers can focus on the core functionality.
+   **Community Support:** Frameworks have active communities that offer developers resources, knowledge-sharing, and support.
+   **Scalability and Maintainability:** Frameworks provide features and patterns that support application growth and long-term maintenance.
+   **Security and Performance:** Frameworks include security measures and performance optimizations to ensure robust and efficient applications.

### Here's an overview of the pros and cons of each framework:

+   **Assess Long-term Maintenance and Support:** React and Vue have active maintenance, while Angular is supported by Google and offers long-term support.

+   **Consider Team Skills and Expertise:** Leverage existing team skills if they have experience with a specific framework, or consider the learning curve and available resources for skill development.


## Adopting a Module Bundler

Module bundlers like [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org), [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/), and [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) have become essential to modern front-end development. They allow you to bundle your project's assets (JavaScript, CSS, images, etc.) into efficient, optimized files for deployment.

### Adopting a module bundler in your pipeline allows for the following:

+   **Code Splitting:** Break your code into smaller, more manageable chunks that can be loaded on-demand.

+   **Tree Shaking:** Eliminate dead code and unused dependencies from your final bundles.

+   **Transpilation:** This is the process of converting modern JavaScript syntax (ES6+) to widely supported ES5 syntax. It ensures that your code is compatible with older browsers that may not support the latest JavaScript features, thereby expanding your application's reach.

+   **Asset Optimization:** Minify, compress, and optimize your assets to reduce file sizes and improve loading times.

### Here's an overview of the pros and cons of each bundler:

### Here's an example of how you can configure Webpack:

1. Install Webpack and required plugins

    ```shell
    npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
    ```
2. Create a Webpack configuration file (e.g., webpack.config.js) in the root of your project:

    ```javaScript
    const path = require('path');

    module.exports = {
      entry: './src/index.js', // Entry point of your application
      output: {
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'), // Output directory
        filename: 'bundle.js', // Output file name
      },
      module: {
        rules: [
          {
            test: /\.js$/, // Apply loaders to JavaScript files
            exclude: /node_modules/,
            use: {
              loader: 'babel-loader', // Example: Use Babel to transpile JavaScript
              options: {
                presets: ['@babel/preset-env'],
              },
            },
          },
          // Add more rules for different file types (e.g., CSS, images, etc.)
        ],
      },
      // Add plugins and other configuration options as needed
    };
    ```


3. Customize the configuration to fit your project's needs

4. Create a script in your package.json file to run Webpack:

    ```JSON
    {
        "scripts": {
            "build": "webpack --config webpack.config.js"
        }
    }
    ```

5. Run Webpack using the configured script:

    ```shell
    npm run build
    ```


## Embracing a CSS Preprocessor

CSS preprocessors such as [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), [Less](https://lesscss.org/), and [Stylus](https://stylus-lang.com/) provide powerful features that extend the capabilities of plain CSS. CSS preprocessors help streamline the development process, reduce code duplication, promote consistency, and enhance code organization; they allow you to write cleaner, more maintainable CSS code by adding:

+   **Variables:** Store reusable values such as colors, fonts, and sizes
+   **Nesting:** Write nested CSS rules to better reflect the structure of your HTML
+   **Mixins:** Create reusable chunks of CSS code that can be included in other stylesheets
+   **Functions:** Perform calculations and manipulate values in your stylesheets. It allows you to create versatile styles that adapt to different situations. For example, you can define a function that generates different font sizes based on screen sizes 

### Here's an overview of the pros and cons of each CSS preprocessor:

### Here's an example of how you can configure Sass in a Webpack project:

1. Install required dependencies  
    ```shell
    npm install sass sass-loader css-loader style-loader --save-dev
    ```

2. Update your Webpack configuration file (webpack.config.js) to add the necessary loaders
    ```javaScript
    module.exports = {
      // ...other configuration options
      module: {
        rules: [
          // ...other rules
          {
            test: /\.s[ac]ss$/i, // Match .scss or .sass files
            use: [
              'style-loader', // Injects styles into the DOM
              'css-loader', // Translates CSS into CommonJS
              'sass-loader', // Compiles Sass to CSS
            ],
          },
        ],
      },
    };
    ```

3. Create a Sass file (e.g., styles.scss) and import it into your JavaScript entry file (e.g., index.js)

    ```scss
    // styles.scss
    body {
      background-color: #f1f1f1;
    }
    ```

    ```javaScript
    // index.js
    import './styles.scss';
    ```

4. Build and run your Webpack project

    ```shell
    npm run build
    ```

## Using Linters and Formatters

Linters and formatters such as [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), and [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) help enforce consistent coding styles and catch potential errors before they become problems. Spend your teamâ€™s time reviewing code and approaches, not formatting issues. And spend less time on issues related to tiny bugs that could have been avoided. Integrating these tools into your build pipeline can:

+   **Improve Code Quality:** Automatically catch syntax errors, potential bugs, and performance issues.
+   **Enforce Coding Standards:** Ensure a consistent coding style across your team, making the codebase easier to read and maintain.
+   **Streamline Code Reviews:** Reduce the time spent on nitpicking code formatting during code reviews by automating the process. 
+   **Avoid Tiny Bugs:**  Without linters, you might overlook common syntax errors and unused variables or parameters.

  
To make the most of these tools, set up pre-commit hooks that automatically lint and format your code before each commit. Here's an example of how you can configure it:

1. Install the required packages
    ```shell
    npm install husky lint-staged eslint prettier --save-dev
    ```

2. **Configure ESLint**: Create an ESLint configuration file (e.g., .eslintrc.js) at the root of your project and specify your desired rules and configurations. For example:
    ```javaScript
    module.exports = {
      // ESLint rules and configurations
      // ...
    };
    ```

3. **Configure Prettier**: Create a Prettier configuration file (e.g., .prettierrc.js) in the root of your project and specify your desired formatting rules. For example:

    ```javascript
    module.exports = {
      // Prettier formatting rules
      // ...
    };
    ```


4. **Configure Husky and lint-staged**: In your package.json file, add the following configuration:

    ```json
    {
       "husky": {
         "hooks": {
           "pre-commit": "lint-staged"
         }
       },
       "lint-staged": {
         "*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}": ["eslint --fix", "prettier --write", "git add"]
       }
    }
    ```

    This configuration sets up a pre-commit hook using Husky that triggers lint-staged, which in turn runs ESLint with the â€”fix flag-to fix linting issues and Prettier to format the code automatically. Finally, it stages the modified files using git add.

5. **Run the pre-commit hook**: When you commit, the pre-commit hook will automatically run ESLint and Prettier on the staged files. If there are any linting errors or formatting inconsistencies, it will attempt to fix them before the commit is made.




## Running tests

Running tests is crucial to JavaScript project development to ensure code quality and reliability. This brief guide will cover two critical types of tests: unit tests and end-to-end testing.

#### Unit Tests 

Unit tests focus on isolating individual units or components of your code. Here's a brief overview: 

+   **Purpose:** Verify the correctness of small, independent units of code.
+   **Scope:** Each test targets a specific function, module, or component.
+   **Dependencies:** External dependencies are often mocked or stubbed to isolate the unit being tested.

## Leveraging Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD)

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are practices that involve automatically building, testing, and deploying your code whenever changes are made. By incorporating CI/CD into your build pipeline, you can:

+   **Catch errors early:** Automatically run tests and linters on every commit, alerting you to potential issues before they reach production.
+   **Code quality analysis:** SonarQube performs static code analysis to identify code smells, bugs, vulnerabilities, and other quality issues. It analyzes your codebase against predefined rules and provides detailed reports highlighting areas that need improvement. Integrating SonarQube into your CI/CD pipeline lets you catch code issues early and ensure that your codebase adheres to best practices and industry standards.
+   **Automate deployments:** Automatically deploy your code to staging or production environments, reducing the risk of human error.
+   **Streamline collaboration:** Ensure that all team members are always working with the latest, error-free code. 

Popular CI/CD platforms include [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), [GitLab CI/CD](https://resources.github.com/ci-cd/), and [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/).

To give you an idea of how a CI/CD platform could work for your team, letâ€™s explore how you could use GitHub Actions.             
  
Start by configuring a GitHub Actions workflow to be triggered when an event occurs in your repository, such as an open or updated pull request. Your workflow may contain one or more jobs that can run in sequential order or in parallel.

**Here's an example of a GitHub Actions workflow:** 

1.  Check whether the PR contains relevant descriptions
2.  Step environment, such as installing nodes, dependencies, pulling code, etc
3.  Run unit tests and linters
4.  Run end-to-end tests in parallel
5.  Run code analysis
6.  Run lighthouse test
7.  Deploy the code to CDN

![screenshot-deploy-the-code-to-cdn.png](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.57blocks.io/cms_uploads/screenshot_deploy_the_code_to_cdn_49bc60e105.png)

### To use GitHub Actions in your project, follow these steps:

1.  **Set up a GitHub repository:** Create a new GitHub repository or navigate to an existing repository where you want to use GitHub Actions.
2.  **Define your workflow:** Create a new directory called .github/workflows inside your repository. This is where you'll define your workflow configuration files.
3.  **Create a workflow file:** Inside the .github/workflows directory, create a new YAML file (e.g., main.yml) to define your workflow's configuration. This file will contain the steps and actions that make up your workflow.
4.  **Define the workflow configuration:** In the workflow file, you'll define the events that trigger the workflow and the jobs that need to be executed. You can use predefined actions, run custom scripts, or combine both. Here's a simple example that runs tests on every push to the main branch:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
```
